# Anthony Esumeh - Portfolio Website

# Project Title:  
Personal Portfolio Website

# Description:  
This is a simple and responsive portfolio website built to showcase my skills, background, and work as a shoemaker.  
The site includes sections like **About Me**, **Gallery**, **Skills & Competency**, and **Contact**.  

# Framework Used:  
I used the Tailwind CSS  
- I chose **Tailwind** because it allows me to quickly design with utility-first classes without writing too much custom CSS.  
- It is lightweight, highly customizable, and works seamlessly with responsive layouts.
- I chose Tailwind because it allows fast customization with utility classes  

# What I Learned: I learnt;  
- How to structure a responsive website using Tailwind’s grid and flexbox utilities.  
- The importance of sectioning content properly for readability and accessibility.  
- How to combine Tailwind utilities with **custom CSS rules** for more control over the design.  
- How to make a navbar sticky only when scrolling.  

# Challenges Faced:  
- Understanding Tailwind’s utility classes at first felt overwhelming.
- Getting the sticky navigation to work properly without covering the content.      
- Balancing the tailwind framework utilities with my own custom CSS rules.  
- Making sure the layout stayed responsive across devices.   

# Live Demo:  
The site will be available here:
